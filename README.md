# C5-E
A web-based metagame for Civ5. Makes your Civ Sessions better! 
Designed to be usable in the steam overlay, so you don't have to tab out of your game.


Doesn't directly interact with the game - Relies on trust and honesty from players, who want a fun, but not overly competitive game!

Built with Flask, using pusher as a backend.

I'll be implementing these in the order shown on this list.
You'll be able turn off any of these features if you want.

If things go well, I'll implement the stretch goals too.
